backbone-sweeper
================

Minesweeper built using backbone.js via Yeoman

With Yeoman installed and configured correctly, start the project up with the command 'yeoman server' in the root directory of the project.

This app was built using an older version of Yeoman. It currently needs to be upgraded to work with the current version.
